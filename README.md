## Fleet:: A Vehicle Management System

What is the purpose of fleet management?
If your business uses vehicles for commercial purposes, then you’ll need some form of professional fleet management. The aim of the operation will be to control the entire lifecycle of commercial vehicles alongside reducing associated risk, improving efficiency, increasing productivity and ensuring compliance with legislation. Employee vehicles used for work purposes, known as the grey fleet, should also be included in this process.

What is fleet management software?
Fleet management software gives your business all the relevant information on the performance of your fleet whenever you want it. In effect, it is a sophisticated database with numerous applications that enables you to record and report the key attributes that can help improve efficiencies and drive down costs by reducing downtime and improving productivity.

In summary, incorporating a software system into fleet management improves the management of:

Vehicles, assets and equipment
Maintenance and repair
Fuel and emissions
Drivers including driver licence checks
Workshops and scheduling – inspections, defect reporting and audits
Parts and inventory
Accident and risk management
Regulatory and legal compliance
Budget and forecasting
